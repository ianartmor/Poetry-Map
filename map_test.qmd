## Poetry Post Mapping Project


Poetry posts are scattered throughout Porltand where neighbors offer us little gifts through poetry: a moment to puase, breathe, and receive inspiration, peache, delight, a new perspective, a sense of connection. We believe poetry posts strengthen our neighborhoods and build community.

## The Map

Below are the poetry posts we've identified so far. 

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(leaflet)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
